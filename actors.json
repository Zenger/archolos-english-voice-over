Over time, as more mages and novices arrived, more buildings were added.\", \"At the very end, a large bridge was erected to connect the monastery to the rest of the island, which would open the place to trade and more frequent pilgrimages.\", \"It is a place of special presence of Adanos. By praying at them, you can calm your mind and regenerate your magical power.\", \"Of course, if you spend more time in sincere prayer, you can count on even more lasting graces.\", \"Unlike Innos, you don't even have to make any offerings of gold, just fervent prayer.\", \"They say wisdom comes with age. It's just a shame that the members of the High Council have long forgotten what those words mean.\", \"Contrary to what people claim, magic is not exclusively the domain of mages. The old books are a good example of this.\", \"The wisdom contained in them, often spanning generations, has something... mystical.\", \"It's good to see you getting in better shape. Your strength is returning day by day and your wounds are healing perfectly.\", \"Adanos has clearly surrounded you with His care.\", \"According to monastic records, these gates were carved into solid rock and encased with protective spells.\", \"The only way to get inside is to get all the pieces of the key.\", \"Whoever built this fortress must have wielded powerful magic. Look how evenly hewn these stones are!\", \"Go ahead, ask.\", \"Since you are so interested in magic, I would have a suggestion for you.\", \"I've been assigned some work to do while I'm still on the island. Perhaps you would be willing to help me with it?\", \"As a reward, I could give you a scroll or two.\"]"
